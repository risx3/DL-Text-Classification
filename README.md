# Text-Classification

Text classification, also known as text categorization, is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to classify text documents into pre-defined categories. It involves assigning one or more categories to a piece of text based on its content, structure, or context.

Text classification can be performed using various machine learning algorithms, such as Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, and Neural Networks. The process of text classification typically involves the following steps:

* Data preprocessing: The raw text data is preprocessed by removing stop words, punctuation, and other non-relevant information.

* Feature extraction: The relevant features are extracted from the preprocessed text data. Common feature extraction techniques include bag-of-words, TF-IDF, and word embeddings.

* Model training: A machine learning algorithm is trained on the extracted features to classify the text documents into pre-defined categories.

* Model evaluation: The performance of the trained model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Text classification has numerous real-world applications, such as email spam filtering, sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and news categorization. It is a powerful technique for automating the process of categorizing and organizing large volumes of text data.
